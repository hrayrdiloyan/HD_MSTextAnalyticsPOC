BNP Paribas delivered a good overall performance this year, showing the strength of its integrated and diversified business model.

Revenues totalled 43,411 million euros, up by 1.1% compared to 2015 despite the low interest rate environment and a lacklustre market context this year. They included this year the exceptional impact of +597 million euros of the capital gain from the sale of Visa Europe shares as well as the 
-59 million euros in Own Credit Adjustment (OCA) and own credit risk included in derivatives (DVA) (+314 million euros in 2015).

Revenues were up by 0.2% in the operating divisions and by 0.9 % at constant scope and exchange rates given an unfavourable exchange rate. They were down by 0.5% in Domestic Markets(1)  (-1.2% at constant scope and exchange rates) due to the low interest rate environment, rose by 1.2% at International Financial Services (+2.7% at constant scope and exchange rates) and decreased by 0.3% at CIB but were up by 1.2% at constant scope and exchange rates despite a particularly challenging market environment in the first quarter of 2016.

Pre-tax income thus came to 2,267 million euros compared to 1,473 million euros in the fourth quarter 2015 (+53.9%).

BNP Paribas posted 1,442 million euros in net income attributable to equity holders 
(665 million euros in the fourth quarter 2015). Excluding exceptional items(17), it was 1,814 million euros, up by 14.3% compared to the same quarter a year earlier.
